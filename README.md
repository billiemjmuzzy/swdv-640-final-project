## Assignment Questions

- How many hours do you estimate you spent completing the assignment? 
    - This week I spent approx 20 hrs. For total project approx 60 hrs.
- What was easiest?
    - Motivation to work on assignment. I found it fun.
- What was most difficult? 
    - Converting to the template system. I wish templating was introduced earlier, so I didn't have to redo so much content.  
- Discuss how you incorporated the feedback you received from the Week 4 peer feedback and heuristic evaluation into your final project. Tell me what feedback was included in your final design and provide specific examples. Please write at least two paragraphs explaining the changes you made. 
    - To be honest, I didn't look at the feedback since week four. I remember thinking that the changes that were suggested would be things I would likely do anyway.  The mock-up software could only do so much, so I could not implement my entire vision.
    Revisiting the feedback confirmed my thinking.  For example, I was told to change the name of a button to something more specific. Of course, I was not going to leave the button name as "Button." Another example is someone said there is no place to purchase supplies. The site is not an e-commerce site. But a person couldn't tell this on a mock-up alone. 
    
        There is still a lot of work to be done with this site, but the work required for the actual website I am working on is beyond the scope of this class, so I simplified it for the class project. The full project requires a CMS, and over 50 different pages need to be created. 
        
        
        While I did not find the initial feedback back itself to be helpful, the act of doing feedback was still beneficial because it was good practice. Ideally, the person giving the feedback would have a better understanding of the full scope of the project, and feedback would be given at different stages of the project.
